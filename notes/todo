Programmatic API for Builder that constructs SegmentTok and friends with stack
frames for the input position. Requires creating a new Reader::Position class
because constructing a Reader::Input to encode the position is yucky.

Implement Builder::FailureState -- the "non-clean" 835 sample files are tripping
the error handling in one of the AbstractState.push methods.

Colorized pretty printer output. Definitions and meta-data should be separately
colored (to blend in with the background), element values should stand out, and
invalid elements should stand out most

Code lookup values in pretty printer output. This will force a design choice on
where the CodeConfig is bound -- globally, to the parse tree, or parameterized?

Evaluate implementation guide conformance regarding ElementReq and SyntaxNote.
This requires interpreting the meaning of SyntaxNote, so its necessarily version
specific.

Update GuideBuilder to ensure SegmentReq, ElementReq, and RepeatCount are only
restricted by the implementation guide and not made less restrictive.

Implement the destructive update methods for both AbstractState subclasses and
for Values/Envelope data types. Need to evaluate when both can be called, when
only the AbstractState can be modified destructively, etc.

Fix the error handling with Reader::TokenReader so StateMachine can know when
reading a segment failed due to EOF at an expected or unexpected boundary.

Create a new AbstractState that bypasses the parse tree. This will be useful
when we want to skip an entire transaction, functional group, or interchange.

Improve the tree traversal API. This is hard to conceive, but perhaps working on
the Editor code will reveal the key problems.
