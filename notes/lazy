To minimize startup costs, lazy loading can be used (autoload)
* Need to ensure high code coverage to ensure syntax errors and other parse-time
  bugs don't hide out in lazy-loaded files which aren't loaded by the test suite

* SegmentDict.constants lazily-loads SegmentDefs

* InterchangeConfig, FunctionalGroupConfig, TransactionSetConfig force loading
  the definitions, so these should be change to be compatible with lazy-loading

* Both of these classes perform similar functionality and should be reviewed to
  examine their similarities and make them more consistent where possible
