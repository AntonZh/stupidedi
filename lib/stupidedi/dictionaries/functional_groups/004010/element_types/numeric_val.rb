#
# One or more digits with an optional leading sign (-). Includes an implied
# decimal point, which is NOT transmitted with the data. The representation
# for this type is "Nn" where N indicates that it is numeric and n indicates
# the number of decimal positions to the right of the implied decimal point.
#
# Leading zeros should be supressed unless necessary to satisfy a minimum
# length requirement. The length does NOT include the optional sign.
