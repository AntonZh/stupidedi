  Errors we'd like the compiler to catch
  ========================================================================================
  * Generating a data element declared "NOT USED" in the HIPAA guide
  * Generating a loop that's omitted from the HIPAA guide
  * Generating a segment that's omitted from the HIPAA guide
  * Generating repeats of an element, segment, or loop when repeats are not allowed
  * Specifying a non-"REQUIRED" implementation condition when the underlying x12 condition
      is "MANDATORY"
  * Generating elements from the wrong data type (ie a string where a numeric should be)
  * Specifying relational conditions on elements in different scopes.

  Errors we'll catch as they occur in the runtime executable
  ========================================================================================
  * Generating values that do not satisfy length requirements. Perhaps we'll truncate or
      pad values in certain usages and not others.
  * Not generating a "MANDATORY" data element. To make the compiler enforce this, we would
      have to require that all MANDATORY elements are passed as arguments to some required
      method call (either a constructor or a method that outputs the segment)
  * Not generating a "REQUIRED" data element
  * Generating an invalid code for an ID element
  * Generating too many repeats of an element, segment, or loop
  * Generating invalid characters

  Errors we'll catch as they occur in the runtime executable (transaction set definitions)
  ========================================================================================
  * Specifying a repeat count in the implementation that exceeds the underlying x12 repeat
      This also applies where the HIPAA guide distinguishes particular instances of segments
      and loops. The sum of the repeat counts from each instance can't exceed the generic
      usage's repeat count from the x12 specification.
  * Specifying a segment more than once in a loop (@todo: not sure that this is an error yet)
  * Specifying a segment with a different offset than defined in the x12 specification
  * Specifying the start segment of a loop elsewhere in the loop or its children loops
  * Specifying more than one segment for a given offset

  Errors we'll catch in a post-generation phase (after they've occured) at runtime
  ========================================================================================
  * Generating unbalanced transactions
  * Generating elements that are not allowed due to Relational element syntax rules.

  Errors we'll prevent via abstraction of the document generation logic
  ========================================================================================
  * Generating segments in the wrong order
  * Generating the wrong segment name
  * Generating the wrong separator for a segment, element, or component
  * Generating elements marked "NOT USED" in the trading partner companion guide. They will
      be quietly supressed, unless the runtime previously raised an error
  * Generating elements that are not allowed due to Relational element syntax rules. They
      will be quietly supressed as long as its valid to do so and the runtime didn't already
      raise an error
  * Generating line breaks in the wrong places (e.g., in the middle of a segment name)
  * Generating incorrectly formatted elements
  * Choosing delimeters that are used within the data. If the data contains a ":", we may
      either try another delimiter or replace each instance of ":" in the data with another
      character.

  Errors we'll prevent via abstraction of the document parsing logic
  ========================================================================================
  * Parsing line breaks, delimiters where they don't belong, etc incorrectly
  * Parsing segments into the wrong loop
  * Parsing segments into the wrong HIPAA-designated location
  * Parsing the wrong seperators for a segment, element, or component
  * Parsing elements marked "NOT USED" in the trading partner companion guide
  * Failing to validate that "REQUIRED" and "MANDATORY" elements and segments are present

  Errors we might not be able to enforce at all
  ========================================================================================
  * Not generating an element or segment that is "SITUATIONAL"-ly required. Some of the
      condition logic might not be expressable in code.
